# Vodka

This is a (until now) simple and light-weight framework made in C. I don't recommend using it for 
professional purposes but if you want to have some fun, move on and try it! The project goal is to be 
as easy to use as Django with the pure C speed.

# Usage

To use the project just use these commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Anthhon/Vodka.git
cd Vodka
make build-linux -B # Doesn't have a proper Windows build command
cd build
./Vodka run
```

# Roadmap

- [X] Create boilerplate server code
- [X] Handle GET requests
- [ ] Handle POST requests
- [ ] Handle DELETE requests
- [ ] Handle OPTIONS requests
- [ ] Server HTML files (IN PROGRESS, Need improvements)
- [ ] Handle 404 errors
