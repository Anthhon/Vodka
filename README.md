# Vodka

This is a (until now) simple and light-weight framework made in C. I don't recommend using it for 
professional purposes but if you want to have some fun, move on and try it! The project goal is to be 
as easy to use as Django with the pure C speed.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Create boilerplate server code
- [ ] Handle requests
- [ ] Server HTML files
- [ ] Handle 404 errors
