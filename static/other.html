            <h3>Why <b>Vodka</b> does even exists?</h3>
            <p>
            I consider Vodka to be my <b>manifesto against the modern, inflated, and complacent market that has emerged in the field of web development.</b> In today's world, where companies exhibit an increasing urgency to release new web pages, products, and features at an ever-accelerating pace, it has become commonplace to encounter new products or frameworks that function as libraries, <b>shielding developers from truly understanding the intricacies beneath the surface.</b> This is often done in exchange for expediting development and facilitating the implementation of features.
            <br>
            <br>
            Consequently, a multitude of frameworks, libraries, and methodologies are seemingly "discovered" or released on a monthly basis. While many find these developments convenient, enthusiasts in the realm of computing may find it somewhat disconcerting to <b>sacrifice knowledge and control in favor of such conveniences.</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>However, merely critiquing the industry and assigning blame without proposing viable solutions or taking concrete action is facile.</b> In response to this predicament, I have developed Vodka as a form of resistance. Vodka is designed to be user-friendly and convenient, yet it refrains from concealing complexities from the developer. All of this is achieved while leveraging the splendid speed and efficiency of the C language.
